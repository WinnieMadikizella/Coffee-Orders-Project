# Coffee-Orders-Project
This project focuses on analyzing coffee orders data to gather insights about customer behavior, product preferences, and sales performance. It utilizes various Excel functions for data processing and visualization to help identify trends and key customer data.

## Data Gathering
- **VLOOKUP**: Used to gather customer data from different tables and match it with order information.
- **INDEX MATCH**: Used to dynamically retrieve product data, offering more flexibility than VLOOKUP.

## Formatting
- **IFS Formula**: Used to generate the full names of coffee types and roast types based on input data.
- **Custom Formats**: Applied custom formatting to columns for date, size, unit price, and sales for better readability.
- **Duplicate Check**: Checked for duplicates in the dataset, and no duplicates were found.
- **Table Formatting**: Converted the data range into an Excel table, ensuring that new data automatically updates as it is added.

## Analysis
- **Total Sales Over Time**: A pivot table was created to calculate total sales over time. This was then visualized using a line graph, with additional filters for size, roast type, and loyalty card status.
- **Sales Per Country**: A bar graph was created to visualize sales distribution across different countries.
- **Top 5 Customers**: Identified the top 5 customers based on the volume of their orders.

## Technologies Used
- **Excel**: The project utilizes advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, IFS, and Pivot Tables.
- **Data Visualization**: Line graphs and bar graphs were used to visualize sales trends and customer behavior.
